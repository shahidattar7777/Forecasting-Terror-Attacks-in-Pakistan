Forecasting Terror Attacks in Pakistan using Python and XGBoost
We have a dataset containing information about terrorist attacks in Pakistan over a 10-year period. However, not all these attacks are claimed by specific groups. This project aims to predict the responsible group for unclaimed attacks based on patterns observed in known attacks. We will use the Random Forest and Boosted Tree model using XGBoost as a machine-learning technique to predict the most likely organization behind unclaimed attacks. We also perform data preprocessing and grouping of organizations to streamline the classification task. 
Major Findings:
1. We found that Boosted tree model has a better accuracy score (78%) that random forest (62%).
2. The results were way better when we grouped together small frequency groups.
